    "### Motivation\n",
    "##### Background\n",
    "Short-term rentals are getting popular and people have been considering short-term accommodations over hotels as an affordable and convenient alternative. Various hosts open up their property for such short-terms and provide services. Their listings are available online which can be browsed by customers before they opt for it. It is very similar to hotels, but anyone can host their property even if it is a small place. There is a lot of diversity in such short-term accommodations and their prices vary largely due to the diverse sets of individual hosts and different types of property hosted.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Potential Impact\n",
    "There are broadly two types of stakeholders - tenants who are either moving in to a new city or tourists who are visiting a city for a considerable amount of time, and hosts who list their property on the short-term rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tenants and tourists moving to a new city would be very interested to know about the cost of living in the city. Particularly, they might be interested to learn how the prices are distributed across different areas of a city. Such information might help them plan their stay according to their budget and standard of living. Also, they might be interested in knowing how the prices vary across different types of property like shared room, private room or an entire house. This information provides transparency and granularity which might help select appropriate listing based on the number of people and their budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "New hosts who are willing to list their property on short-term rental portals might be very interested to set an appropriate price for their listing. Predicting prices based on the neighborhood, and property type would be helpful to support these needs. Also, if a host is planning to build a property to rent, they might be interested in knowing what type of property to build. Understanding the distribution of types of property in a neighborhood might help hosts get an insight to make their decision."

    "##### Feature Selection and Encoding\n",
    "The attributes required for the analysis to answer the above stated research questions would be retained,\n",
    "and all other attributes would be removed. Appropriate encoding would be used based on the type of data.\n",
    "For instance, z-score (mean centered and standardization) [[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)] would be used for numerical values,\n",

    "- **Q2.** The data would be grouped based on ```room_type```, and different aggregate metrics for the price\n",

    "```neighborhood_group``` to observe how prices vary for different types of property across neighborhoods.\n",
    "A set of box-plots (for each room-type) can be put in a sections for each neighborhood to visualize the distribution.\n",
    "- **Q3.** A linear regression model [[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)] can be built on the few selected independent variables like neighborhood and room type\n",
    "to predict the price of the listing. This model could be trained on a subset of data and evaluated on a held-out subset\n",
    "to determine our effectiveness in prediction. This model can be evaluated on the R-squared metric [[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination)].\n",
    "Interpretation of the model coefficients can help in understanding the model inferences.\n",
    "- **Q4.** The data can be grouped based on ```neighborhood_group```, and aggregate metrics based on counts of\n",

    "Ease of readability and ethical data science conisderations have informed the way this study as been designed. The methods chosen are basic and standard approaches which could enable this project to be consumed by a large audience. Note that a consistent types of visualization has been maintained to make it easier for users to consume the analysis, and multiple small plots approach is taken to make it easier for visual comparison which is effective for humans consumption. The research questions are human-centred as they are based on the stakeholder to which an answer to the research question would be directly applicable. These analyses do not use any personal information, and are indended to help the respective stakeholders to get data-centric insights.\n"
